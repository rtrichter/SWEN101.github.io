                    Hi! My name is Ryan Richter. I grew up near Albany, New York and moved to Burlington (and soon Cambridge) Vermont this year. I graduated from Averill Park High School with a top 10 ranking in my class. I play the saxophone (follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/courtyardrit/">@courtyardrit</a> on instagram). I also play ultimate frisbee and tennis. I am on the RIT Formula SAE team as well as the VEXU team. I have a dog (silver lab) named Aussie who is 2.5 years old. Lastly, I have a skeleton named Herbert that I take pictures of during October. Every day of the month I post one to my insagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ryanrichter028">@ryanrichter028</a>). This is my third year posting pictures of him every day.

                <ul>
                    <li>I'd like to learn about good practices when developing software. </li>
                    <li>The hardest part of programming for me was always planning, so learning how to gather requirements, make prototypes, etc is really helpful</li>
                    <li>I am learning a lot about working with a team and managing projects between multiple people by working in groups</li>
                    <li>The course is already helping me organize projects and tasks as I have started using trello for my every day life</li>

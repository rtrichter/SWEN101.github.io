            <ul>
                <li>I'd like to learn about good practices when developing software. </li>
                <li>The hardest part of programming for me was always planning, so learning how to gather requirements, make prototypes, etc is really helpful</li>
                <li>I am learning a lot about working with a team and managing projects between multiple people by working in groups</li>
                <li>The course is already helping me organize projects and tasks as I have started using trello for my every day life</li>
